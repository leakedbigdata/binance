Yesterday, I read an article on the Dark Web that made me think these kids are quite humorous. 

They take other people's data and post it as their own. This leaked data came from a Telegram channel: [@leakedbigdata](https://t.me/leakedbigdata/ "@leakedbigdata"), where I contacted them and purchased the data for $500—all of it.

Meanwhile, some kids resell it for thousands of dollars. That’s the difference between scammers and genuine sellers. 

The Telegram channel claims the data is from 2023 and took time to mine, and the downloaded data is dated November 2023,unlike what’s posted on the Dark Web, like on https://dailydarkweb.net/binance-user-data-allegedly-leaked-on-a-dark-web-forum/.

It’s truly a funny scam. When I asked the admin why he doesn't sell on the Dark Web to avoid scammers,he explained that every action on the Dark Web is monitored, and even a small mistake can lead to consequences. 

He mentioned many people request larger samples, but it's usually for scamming purposes. 

How many buyers have already been deceived? If you want quality data, ask sellers for larger samples to see if they can actually provide them. 

I’m sure they can’t. Always look for quality sellers.

## He has posted and stopped selling this data now. Fortunately, I bought this file before. 

# They are the scammers. Please take note.
